# Project LightYourHearth-mobile
The goal of this project is to connect a rpi with ledstrips with individually adressable leds.
It will then be controllable with a bluetooth connection using a phone app.

## RPI
The bluetooth server and ledstrip connection on the rpi are made with Python3.

## Phone App
The phone app used to connect and control the ledstrip is made with Xamarin.
